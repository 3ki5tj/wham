The main changes are listed below

* We have clarified in the abstract that our technique is applicable also to MBAR.  We thank the referee to point this out.  We did not add MBAR to the title, as it would make the title too long.

* We have added MBAR to the first sentence of the last paragraph in the introduction.

* In footnote 1, we have added a citation to Ref. 13. We believe the idea of composite-ensemble can be traced back at least to this reference.  In the reference, however,the argument is actually applied to the expanded ensemble for simulated tempering, which differs slightly from the composite ensemble. Therefore, we have also added the necessary changes in using WHAM for simulated tempering to explain the difference.

* Eq. (6) we have added parentheses around f_k, according the referee's suggestion.

* In the paragraph containing Eq. (6), we have added a sentence to clarify the relationship between MBAR and WHAM, according the referee's suggestion.  That is, MBAR can be treated both a special form (the histogram-free form, and hence the zero-bin-width limit) of WHAM, and also as a generalisation of WHAM with for Hamiltonians with nonlinear parameter dependence.

* For the caption of Figure 2, we added a sentence to explain how we handled the correlated data in the MD trajectory in bootstrapping.

* In Section 3.4, we have moved the phrase "in aqueous solution" after "villin headpiece".

* In Section 3.4, we have specified the GROMACS version and force field, which were missing from the previous version.  Three more recent citations of GROMACS were also added.

* In Section 3.4, we have added a brief discussion on the comparison between MBAR and WHAM, according to the referee's suggestion.  As the referee suggested, when both methods are applicable, MBAR is much slower than WHAM.  However, it gives the zero-bin-width limit of WHAM, which can be useful.

* In Section 3.4, we have found the difference between WHAM and ST-WHAM was due to the use of an inexact algorithm in simulation.  The original simulation used different temperature coupling groups for the thermostat.  This, however, appeared to be done through an inexact algorithm, when the center of mass motion had to be removed.  We have changed the setting and redone the simulations.  We found that based on the new simulation protocol, WHAM and ST-WHAM yielded much closer results.

* Figures 2 and 5 have been redone because of the above change.

* We have added a paragraph in Appendix A to directly derive the MBAR result, Eq. (6), from the composite ensemble viewpoint.  This provides a further link between the WHAM and MBAR: both methods can be readily derived in the composite ensemble.

* In Appendix B, we have added a sentence to point out the limitation of our analysis: it does not take into account sampling error.  And the actual rate of convergence can be smaller.
