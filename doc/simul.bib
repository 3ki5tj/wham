The estimation strategy depends on the extent of overlap between the two ensembles, on the smoothness of the density-of-states as a function of the difference potential, and on the relative Monte Carlo sampling costs, per statistically independent data point. The best estimate of the free energy difference is usually obtained by dividing the available computer time approximately equally between the two ensembles; its efficiency (variance x computer time)-1 is never less, and may be several orders of magnitude greater, than that obtained by sampling only one ensemble, as is done in perturbation theory.

The formulation is general and allows optimal calculation of the free energies from a set of molecular dynamics simulations generated in the presence of arbitrary biasing umbrella sampling window potentials. The method yields the free energy associated with a given simulation as well as the probability distribution of the molecular system configurations by extracting the information contained in all the biased simulations (the windows) in an optimal way. The method presents some advantages compared to the standard free energy perturbation (FEP) and thermodynamic integration (TI) methods, because the window potential can be used for restricting the conformational space to specific regions during free energy calculations.

We also study how parameters (temperature, pressure, etc.) of the independent simulations should be chosen to optimize the accuracy of the set of free energies. "
