Computer simulators are continuously confronted with questions concerning the choice of a particular technique for a given application. A wide variety of tools exist, so the choice of technique requires a good understanding of the basic principles. More importantly, such understanding may greatly improve the efficiency of a simulation program. The implementation of simulation methods is illustrated in pseudocodes and their practical use in the case studies used in the text.<br><br>Since the first edition only five years ago, the simulation world has changed significantly -- current techniques have matured and new ones have appeared. This new edition deals with these new developments; in particular, there are sections on:<br><br>· Transition path sampling and diffusive barrier crossing to simulaterare events<br>· Dissipative particle dynamic as a course-grained simulation technique<br>· Novel schemes to compute the long-ranged forces<br>· Hamiltonian and non-Hamiltonian dynamics in the context constant-temperature and constant-pressure molecular dynamics simulations<br>· Multiple-time step algorithms as an alternative for constraints<br>· Defects in solids<br>· The pruned-enriched Rosenbluth sampling, recoil-growth, and concerted rotations for complex molecules<br>· Parallel tempering for glassy Hamiltonians<br><br>Examples are included that highlight current applications and the codes of case studies are available on the World Wide Web. Several new examples have been added since the first edition to illustrate recent applications. Questions are included in this new edition. No prior knowledge of computer simulation is assumed.}

This method is related to simulated annealing, but here the temperature becomes a dynamic variable, and the system is always kept at equilibrium. We analyse the method on the Random Field Ising Model, and we find a dramatic improvement over conventional Metropolis and cluster methods. We analyse and discuss the conditions under which the method has optimal performances.}

A characteristic feature of these dynamics is the presence of a history-dependent potential term that, in time, fills the minima in the FES, allowing the efficient exploration and accurate determination of the FES as a function of the collective coordinates. We demonstrate the usefulness of this approach in the case of the dissociation of a NaCl molecule in water and in the study of the conformational changes of a dialanine in solution.},

  abstract={Metadynamics is a powerful algorithm that can be used both for reconstructing the free energy and for accelerating rare events in systems described by complex Hamiltonians, at the classical or at the quantum level. In the algorithm the normal evolution of the system is biased by a history-dependent potential constructed as a sum of Gaussians centered along the trajectory followed by a suitably chosen set of collective variables. The sum of Gaussians is exploited for reconstructing iteratively an estimator of the free energy and forcing the system to escape from local minima. This review is intended to provide a comprehensive description of the algorithm, with a focus on the practical aspects that need to be addressed when one attempts to apply metadynamics to a new system: (i) the choice of the appropriate set of collective variables; (ii) the optimal choice of the metadynamics parameters and (iii) how to control the error and ensure convergence of the algorithm.}

It is a generalization of the Hybrid Monte Carlo algorithm allowing the trajectory length to be shrunk to the step-size without losing on the speed of configuration decorrelation. Without the Monte Carlo step, this limit of the generalized algorithm reduces to the second-order Langevin equation. The latter is shown in a gaussian model and in compact QED to be faster than the Hybrid algorithm. The performance of the two algorithms with the Monte Carlo step, HMC and L2MC, turned out to be comparable in compact QED. It is pointed out that L2MC is safer from rounding errors. "

  abstract = "Near-optimal strategies are developed for estimating the free energy difference between two canonical ensembles, given a Metropolis-type Monte Carlo program for sampling each one. The estimation strategy depends on the extent of overlap between the two ensembles, on the smoothness of the density-of-states as a function of the difference potential, and on the relative Monte Carlo sampling costs, per statistically independent data point. The best estimate of the free energy difference is usually obtained by dividing the available computer time approximately equally between the two ensembles; its efficiency (variance x computer time)-1 is never less, and may be several orders of magnitude greater, than that obtained by sampling only one ensemble, as is done in perturbation theory.

The formulation is general and allows optimal calculation of the free energies from a set of molecular dynamics simulations generated in the presence of arbitrary biasing umbrella sampling window potentials. The method yields the free energy associated with a given simulation as well as the probability distribution of the molecular system configurations by extracting the information contained in all the biased simulations (the windows) in an optimal way. The method presents some advantages compared to the standard free energy perturbation (FEP) and thermodynamic integration (TI) methods, because the window potential can be used for restricting the conformational space to specific regions during free energy calculations.

It was found that the probable reaction path, describing the transition of the ring from the exterior to the interior of the channel where it blocked the permeation pathway, involved several steps including the isomerization of the transpeptide plane dihedral angle of Val1. Reaction coordinates along this pathway were defined, and the transition rates between the stable conformers were calculated. It was found, in good accord with experimental observations, that the calculated blocking rate for the RR-linked channel was 280/s with a mean blocking time of 0.04 ms, whereas such blocking did not occur in the case of the SS-linked channel. An important observation is that the resulting lifetime for the blocked state of the RR-linked channel was in good accord with the experimental observations only when the calculations were performed in the presence of a potassium ion inside the channel.

The algorithm, based on free-energy differences, provides a more natural way of approaching the problem and improves convergence compared to the widely used direct iteration method. We also study how parameters (temperature, pressure, etc.) of the independent simulations should be chosen to optimize the accuracy of the set of free energies. "

The software has been developed for a custom-designed 32-processor ring GROMACS (GROningen MAchine for Chemical Simulation) with communication to and from left and right neighbours, but can run on any parallel system onto which a a ring of processors can be mapped and which supports PVM-like block send and receive calls. The GROMACS software consists of a preprocessor, a parallel MD and energy minimization program that can use an arbitrary number of processors (including one), an optional monitor, and several analysis tools. The programs are written in ANSI C and available by ftp (information: gromacs@chem.rug.nl). The functionality is based on the GROMOS (GROningen MOlecular Simulation) package (van Gunsteren and Berendsen, 1987; BIOMOS B.V., Nijenborgh 4, 9747 AG Groningen). Conversion programs between GROMOS and GROMACS formats are included. The MD program can handle rectangular periodic boundary conditions with temperature and pressure scaling. The interactions that can be handled without modification are variable non-bonded pair interactions with Coulomb and Lennard-Jones or Buckingham potentials, using a twin-range cut-off based on charge groups, and fixed bonded interactions of either harmonic or constraint type for bonds and bond angles and either periodic or cosine power series interactions for dihedral angles. Special forces can be added to groups of particles (for non-equilibrium dynamics or for position restraining) or between particles (for distance restraints). The parallelism is based on particle decomposition. Interprocessor communication is largely limited to position and force distribution over the ring once per time step. "

  abstract = { Molecular simulation is an extremely useful, but computationally very expensive tool for studies of chemical and biomolecular systems. Here, we present a new implementation of our molecular simulation toolkit GROMACS which now both achieves extremely high performance on single processors from algorithmic optimizations and hand-coded routines and simultaneously scales very well on parallel machines. The code encompasses a minimal-communication domain decomposition algorithm, full dynamic load balancing, a state-of-the-art parallel constraint solver, and efficient virtual site algorithms that allow removal of hydrogen atom degrees of freedom to enable integration time steps up to 5 fs for atomistic simulations also in parallel. To improve the scaling properties of the common particle mesh Ewald electrostatics algorithms, we have in addition used a Multiple-Program, Multiple-Data approach, with separate node domains responsible for direct and reciprocal space interactions. Not only does this combination of algorithms enable extremely long simulations of large systems but also it provides that simulation performance on quite modest numbers of standard cluster nodes. }

  abstract ={Motivation: Molecular simulation has historically been a low-throughput technique, but faster computers and increasing amounts of genomic and structural data are changing this by enabling large-scale automated simulation of, for instance, many conformers or mutants of biomolecules with or without a range of ligands. At the same time, advances in performance and scaling now make it possible to model complex biomolecular interaction and function in a manner directly testable by experiment. These applications share a need for fast and efficient software that can be deployed on massive scale in clusters, web servers, distributed computing or cloud resources.Results: Here, we present a range of new simulation algorithms and features developed during the past 4 years, leading up to the GROMACS 4.5 software package. The software now automatically handles wide classes of biomolecules, such as proteins, nucleic acids and lipids, and comes with all commonly used force fields for these molecules built-in. GROMACS supports several implicit solvent models, as well as new free-energy algorithms, and the software now uses multithreading for efficient parallelization even on low-end systems, including windows-based workstations. Together with hand-tuned assembly kernels and state-of-the-art parallelization, this provides extremely high performance and cost efficiency for high-throughput as well as massively parallel simulations.Availability: GROMACS is an open source and free software available from http://www.gromacs.org.Contact: erik.lindahl@scilifelab.seSupplementary information: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

  abstract = "Based on a recent method of Pople et al for the solution of large systems of linear equations, a procedure is given for accelerating the convergence of slowly converging quasi-Newton— Raphson type algorithms. This procedure is particularly advantageous if the number of parameters is so large that the calculation and storage of the hessian is no longer practical. Application to the SCF problem is treated in detail. "

Starting with an unfolded state of villin headpiece subdomain, hydrophobic collapse and helix formation occur in an initial phase, followed by conformational readjustments. A marginally stable state, which has a lifetime of about 150 nanoseconds, a favorable solvation free energy, and shows significant resemblance to the native structure, is observed; two pathways to this state have been found.},

  abstract = "Abstract Simulated tempering (ST) has attracted a great deal of attention in the last years, due to its capability to allow systems with complex dynamics to escape from regions separated by large entropic barriers. However its performance is strongly dependent on basic ingredients, such as the choice of the set of temperatures and their associated weights. Since the weight evaluations are not trivial tasks, an alternative approximated approach was proposed by Park and Pande (2007) to circumvent this difficulty. Here we present a detailed study about this procedure by comparing its performance with exact (free-energy) weights and other methods, its dependence on the total replica number R and on the temperature set. The ideas above are analyzed in four distinct lattice models presenting strong first-order phase transitions, hence constituting ideal examples in which the performance of algorithm is fundamental. In all cases, our results reveal that approximated weights work properly in the regime of larger R ’s. On the other hand, for sufficiently small R its performance is reduced and the systems do not cross properly the free-energy barriers. Finally, for estimating reliable temperature sets, we consider a simple protocol proposed by Valentim et al. (2014). "

This expansion has a different feature from the moment and cumulant expansions, and has a convenient form to introduce the long-time approximation as well as the short-time approximation. Its application to the anomalous relaxation and transport phenomena near the second-order phase transition points is discussed.An expansion formula is also obtained for the time evolution of dynamical quantities in order to describe the various modes of motion involved according to their characteristic time constants. These two expansions are closely related to the time-correlation function formalism of irreversible processes, and allow us to have physical intutition in calculating dissipative properties.},

(Standard jackknife theory gives an approximate mean and variance in the case R(X, F) = θ(F̂) - θ(F), θ some parameter of interest.) A general method, called the "bootstrap," is introduced, and shown to work satisfactorily on a variety of estimation problems. The jackknife is shown to be a linear approximation method for the bootstrap. The exposition proceeds by a series of examples: variance of the sample median, error rates in a linear discriminant analysis, ratio estimation, estimating regression parameters, etc.},

Mathematically, it amounts to studying the long-time behaviour of a stochastic process which satisfies a nonlinear stochastic differential equation, where the drift depends on conditional expectations of some functionals of the process. We use entropy techniques to prove exponential convergence to the stationary state.}

It is motivated by statistical learning arguments and unifies the tasks of biasing the molecular dynamics to escape free energy wells and estimating the free energy function, under the same objective of minimizing the Kullback–Leibler divergence between appropriately selected densities. It offers rigorous convergence diagnostics even though history dependent, non-Markovian dynamics are employed. It makes use of a greedy optimization scheme in order to obtain sparse representations of the free energy function which can be particularly useful in multidimensional cases. It employs embarrassingly parallelizable sampling schemes that are based on adaptive Sequential Monte Carlo and can be readily coupled with legacy molecular dynamics simulators. The sequential nature of the learning and sampling scheme enables the efficient calculation of free energy functions parametrized by the temperature. The characteristics and capabilities of the proposed method are demonstrated in three numerical examples. "

  abstract = {The effect of scaling the molecular velocities to a fixed total energy in molecular dynamics simulations within the (N,V,E) ensemble has been investigated. The effect of using different time steps is also discussed. It is found that, even for small time steps, velocity scaling has a substantial influence on the resulting molecular trajectories, velocities, and forces. Furthermore, velocity rescaling and larger time step seem to have an additive effect on the calculated trajectories, but not on the average thermodynamic properties, such as temperature, pressure, and energy.}
