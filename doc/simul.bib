  abstract = {Understanding Molecular Simulation: From Algorithms to Applications explains the physics behind the ``recipes'' of molecular simulation for materials science. Computer simulators are continuously confronted with questions concerning the choice of a particular technique for a given application. A wide variety of tools exist, so the choice of technique requires a good understanding of the basic principles. More importantly, such understanding may greatly improve the efficiency of a simulation program. The implementation of simulation methods is illustrated in pseudocodes and their practical use in the case studies used in the text.<br><br>Since the first edition only five years ago, the simulation world has changed significantly -- current techniques have matured and new ones have appeared. This new edition deals with these new developments; in particular, there are sections on:<br><br>· Transition path sampling and diffusive barrier crossing to simulaterare events<br>· Dissipative particle dynamic as a course-grained simulation technique<br>· Novel schemes to compute the long-ranged forces<br>· Hamiltonian and non-Hamiltonian dynamics in the context constant-temperature and constant-pressure molecular dynamics simulations<br>· Multiple-time step algorithms as an alternative for constraints<br>· Defects in solids<br>· The pruned-enriched Rosenbluth sampling, recoil-growth, and concerted rotations for complex molecules<br>· Parallel tempering for glassy Hamiltonians<br><br>Examples are included that highlight current applications and the codes of case studies are available on the World Wide Web. Several new examples have been added since the first edition to illustrate recent applications. Questions are included in this new edition. No prior knowledge of computer simulation is assumed.}

This method is related to simulated annealing, but here the temperature becomes a dynamic variable, and the system is always kept at equilibrium. We analyse the method on the Random Field Ising Model, and we find a dramatic improvement over conventional Metropolis and cluster methods. We analyse and discuss the conditions under which the method has optimal performances.}

Simulations in the multicanonical ensemble by the three methods are performed for a penta peptide, Met-enkephalin. For each algorithm, it is shown that from only one simulation run one cannot only find the global minimum energy conformation but also obtain probability distributions in the canonical ensemble at any temperature, which allows the calculation of any thermodynamic quantity as a function of temperature.

We demonstrate the usefulness of this approach in the case of the dissociation of a NaCl molecule in water and in the study of the conformational changes of a dialanine in solution.},

It is a generalization of the Hybrid Monte Carlo algorithm allowing the trajectory length to be shrunk to the step-size without losing on the speed of configuration decorrelation. Without the Monte Carlo step, this limit of the generalized algorithm reduces to the second-order Langevin equation. The latter is shown in a gaussian model and in compact QED to be faster than the Hybrid algorithm. The performance of the two algorithms with the Monte Carlo step, HMC and L2MC, turned out to be comparable in compact QED. It is pointed out that L2MC is safer from rounding errors. "

  abstract = "Near-optimal strategies are developed for estimating the free energy difference between two canonical ensembles, given a Metropolis-type Monte Carlo program for sampling each one. The estimation strategy depends on the extent of overlap between the two ensembles, on the smoothness of the density-of-states as a function of the difference potential, and on the relative Monte Carlo sampling costs, per statistically independent data point. The best estimate of the free energy difference is usually obtained by dividing the available computer time approximately equally between the two ensembles; its efficiency (variance x computer time)-1 is never less, and may be several orders of magnitude greater, than that obtained by sampling only one ensemble, as is done in perturbation theory.

The formulation is general and allows optimal calculation of the free energies from a set of molecular dynamics simulations generated in the presence of arbitrary biasing umbrella sampling window potentials. The method yields the free energy associated with a given simulation as well as the probability distribution of the molecular system configurations by extracting the information contained in all the biased simulations (the windows) in an optimal way. The method presents some advantages compared to the standard free energy perturbation (FEP) and thermodynamic integration (TI) methods, because the window potential can be used for restricting the conformational space to specific regions during free energy calculations.

The GROMACS software consists of a preprocessor, a parallel MD and energy minimization program that can use an arbitrary number of processors (including one), an optional monitor, and several analysis tools. The programs are written in ANSI C and available by ftp (information: gromacs@chem.rug.nl). The functionality is based on the GROMOS (GROningen MOlecular Simulation) package (van Gunsteren and Berendsen, 1987; BIOMOS B.V., Nijenborgh 4, 9747 AG Groningen). Conversion programs between GROMOS and GROMACS formats are included. The MD program can handle rectangular periodic boundary conditions with temperature and pressure scaling. The interactions that can be handled without modification are variable non-bonded pair interactions with Coulomb and Lennard-Jones or Buckingham potentials, using a twin-range cut-off based on charge groups, and fixed bonded interactions of either harmonic or constraint type for bonds and bond angles and either periodic or cosine power series interactions for dihedral angles. Special forces can be added to groups of particles (for non-equilibrium dynamics or for position restraining) or between particles (for distance restraints). The parallelism is based on particle decomposition. Interprocessor communication is largely limited to position and force distribution over the ring once per time step. "

  abstract = { Molecular simulation is an extremely useful, but computationally very expensive tool for studies of chemical and biomolecular systems. Here, we present a new implementation of our molecular simulation toolkit GROMACS which now both achieves extremely high performance on single processors from algorithmic optimizations and hand-coded routines and simultaneously scales very well on parallel machines. The code encompasses a minimal-communication domain decomposition algorithm, full dynamic load balancing, a state-of-the-art parallel constraint solver, and efficient virtual site algorithms that allow removal of hydrogen atom degrees of freedom to enable integration time steps up to 5 fs for atomistic simulations also in parallel. To improve the scaling properties of the common particle mesh Ewald electrostatics algorithms, we have in addition used a Multiple-Program, Multiple-Data approach, with separate node domains responsible for direct and reciprocal space interactions. Not only does this combination of algorithms enable extremely long simulations of large systems but also it provides that simulation performance on quite modest numbers of standard cluster nodes. }

Starting with an unfolded state of villin headpiece subdomain, hydrophobic collapse and helix formation occur in an initial phase, followed by conformational readjustments. A marginally stable state, which has a lifetime of about 150 nanoseconds, a favorable solvation free energy, and shows significant resemblance to the native structure, is observed; two pathways to this state have been found.},

  abstract ={A continued-fraction expansion of the Laplace transform of the time-correlation functions is obtained, which enables us to express the generalized susceptibilities and the transport coefficients in terms of the static correlation functions of a set of quantities. This expansion has a different feature from the moment and cumulant expansions, and has a convenient form to introduce the long-time approximation as well as the short-time approximation. Its application to the anomalous relaxation and transport phenomena near the second-order phase transition points is discussed.An expansion formula is also obtained for the time evolution of dynamical quantities in order to describe the various modes of motion involved according to their characteristic time constants. These two expansions are closely related to the time-correlation function formalism of irreversible processes, and allow us to have physical intutition in calculating dissipative properties.},
