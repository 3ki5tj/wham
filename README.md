# Weight histogram analysis method (WHAM)


This project is about using a linear algebra optimization method,
the method of direct inversion in the iterative subspace (DIIS),
to accelerate a standard free energy method,
weighted histogram analysis method (WHAM).

We also study a few WHAM related methods, including

* Weighted histogram analysis method (WHAM).
* Bennett's acceptance ratio (BAR) method.
* Multistate Bennett's acceptance ratio (MBAR) method.
* Statistical temperature WHAM (ST-WHAM).
* Umbrella integration method (UIM).
