# Notes #


## number of temperatures

Same temperature range, T = [1.5, 3.1]
40 temperatures,  2415 iterations
80 temperatures,  2610 iterations
160 temperatures, 2840 iterations

## number of simulation steps

Does not appear to have a significant effect


## complexity

Away from the critical point T = [3.0, 4.6]
number of iterations significantly reduced
40 temperatures, 166 iterations.
160 temperaturs, 159 iterations.
